The headless client can participate in pipeline runs. To do that the pipeline owner needs to add the client to the run.

To run the client you'll need to set the following environment variables
```
SERVER_API_USERNAME - Username that the client will use to login to the COINSTAC API
SERVER_API_PASSWORD - Password that the client will use to login to the COINSTAC API
HEADLESS_CLIENT_ID - Headless Client ID that was created on the COINSTAC API
```
